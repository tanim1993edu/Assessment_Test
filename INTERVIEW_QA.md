# Assessment Project Interview Questions & Answers

## Project Overview Questions

1. **Q: Explain the architecture of your automation framework.**
   ```
   A: The framework follows a Page Object Model (POM) architecture with clear separation of concerns:
   - pages/ - Contains page objects for UI interactions
   - tests/ - Houses test cases (both UI and API)
   - utils/ - Provides configuration and utilities
   - conftest.py - Manages pytest fixtures and test setup
   Key features include cross-browser support, parallel execution, and comprehensive reporting.
   ```
